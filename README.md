Overview of the Project:

The goal is to create video content and ads for a Chrome extension (ChatGPT Toolbox) that aims to increase installations from the US market. The target is to create 30 videos for Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and TikTok, with content that feels authentic and simple, like UGC (User Generated Content), voiceovers, screencapture, and even AI-generated voiceovers.
1st Milestone: Research, Brainstorming, and References

Budget: $10 - $30

For this milestone, I'll perform research, brainstorm, and provide 5-6 video content ideas, alongside reference examples for each concept. The focus will be on simple, authentic content that resonates with the target audience and promotes the Chrome extension.
Deliverables:

    5-6 Video Ideas: Concepts that align with the goals (installations, simple and authentic content).
    References: Similar campaigns and ideas found on platforms like TikTok, Meta, and other social media platforms that align with the UGC-style approach.

Examples of potential content ideas:

    Simple Demo Video: Showcasing the extension in action, highlighting how it works with ChatGPT.
    Voiceover with Screen Recording: Narrating the experience of installing and using the extension.
    UGC-style Testimonial: Someone talking about the benefits of the extension.
    AI Voiceover Explanation: Using an AI voiceover to explain the features in a casual tone.
    "Day in the Life" with the Extension: Highlighting how the extension improves daily tasks for users.

2nd Milestone: Create 1 Ad in Vertical Format

Budget: To Be Discussed (Typically $50 - $100 for quality)

In this milestone, the task is to create a 30-40 second ad in vertical format, based on the ideas from Milestone 1. It will include a clear CTA directing users to the Chrome Web Store to install the extension.
Deliverables:

    1 Vertical Ad (30-40 seconds): This will be simple, quick, and easy to understand, with a clear call to action.
    Video Editing: Basic cuts, adding a CTA, and ensuring the video is engaging but straightforward (no flashy effects).

3rd Milestone: Create 3 Different Videos

Budget: To Be Discussed (Typically $100 - $250 for quality)

In this milestone, I'll create three different video concepts, each with two versions:

    15-second version: Short, concise, and punchy.
    30-40 second version: A slightly more detailed version, explaining the product more clearly.

The focus will remain on creating authentic, engaging content that aligns with Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and TikTok style.
Deliverables:

    3 Video Concepts (Each with 15s and 30-40s version)
        Videos will be made in vertical format.
        Simple and effective content with voiceovers, screen captures, AI-generated voiceovers.

4th Milestone: Create 26 Videos in Different Lengths

Budget: To Be Discussed (Typically $500 - $1000 for quality)

This milestone will involve creating 26 more videos, each in different lengths (15s, 20s, 30s, 40s). These videos will follow the concepts approved in previous milestones but be varied in length for different social platform placements and ad types.
Deliverables:

    26 Videos in varying lengths (15s, 20s, 30s, and 40s).
    All videos will be vertical format.
    Videos will include simple, engaging content (no complex editing).
    CTA: Direct users to the Chrome Web Store to download and install the extension.
    Videos will be tailored for TikTok, Instagram, and Meta Ads.

Additional Details:

    Platform Optimization: All videos will be optimized for TikTok and Meta platforms to ensure good engagement and conversions.
    Editing: Videos will not require complex edits, but may involve basic cuts, adding text overlays (for CTA), and voiceovers. Simplicity is key.
    Voiceover: I will use AI-generated voiceovers if needed, or natural voiceovers for simplicity.
